  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Shop the Look · Effective date: February 11, 2026</p>

  <p>Shop the Look ("we", "our", "the app") respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos you submit.</strong> When you analyze an outfit, the image is sent to our servers and third-party AI services (Google Gemini, Google Lens) for clothing detection and product matching. We do not store your photos after processing is complete.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase & subscription data.</strong> If you subscribe to a premium plan, payment is handled by Apple (In-App Purchase) and RevenueCat. We receive a pseudonymous user ID and subscription status — not your payment details.</li>
    <li><strong>Device identifiers.</strong> We may collect anonymous device IDs for analytics (crash reports, usage statistics).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data.</strong> Screens viewed, features used, and interaction events to improve the app experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To analyze outfit photos and return product matches.</li>
    <li>To manage your subscription and unlock premium features.</li>
    <li>To improve app performance and fix bugs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following third-party services, each with their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google (Gemini AI, Google Lens)</a> — image analysis</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">RevenueCat</a> — subscription management</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple</a> — In-App Purchases, App Store</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Photos are processed in real-time and not stored beyond the analysis session. Subscription data is retained as long as your account is active. Analytics data is aggregated and anonymized.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete the app at any time to stop all data collection.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of any stored data by contacting us.</li>
    <li>If you are in the EU/UK, you have rights under GDPR including access, rectification, and erasure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
